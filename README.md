#### Problem Statement
Chicago is a great city to live in or travel to, but it is important to be aware of the dangers it can pose to someone traveling within it. In this past year alone (2021) there have been over 30,318 committed crimes in the city (CPD). This includes: murder, sexual assualt, robbery, battery, burglary, theft, and vehicle theft. Being the third largest city in the United States, Chicago is home to many popular attractions and places to visit but having the knowledge to navigate the city and be aware of your surroundings is an important skill to have while being in the Windy City.
While living or traveling in Chicago you would want to know where the most dangerous areas are, and how to avoid them. Being able to meet up with others to make your commute safer is also a great option. Having a quick way to contact police or friends/loved ones could potentially save you from being in harm's way. Seeing which CTA busses or train lines have the most dangerous activity can help you to avoid situations that nobody wants to be in. These are only some of the solutions to this massive problem for resident and out of town commuters in Chicago.
